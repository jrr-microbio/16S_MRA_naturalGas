## Abstract
Environmental gene profiling can provide valuable insights into low biomass microbial communities inhabiting subsurface environments. To access the prokaryotic diversity of an active natural gas storage field, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on formation water to provide insights into the taxonomic composition of microbial groups potentially capable of metabolizing stored fuel gases in the geologic reservoir.
